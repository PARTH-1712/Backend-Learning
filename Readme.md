# Summary of this Project (In the Building Phase)
This project is a complex backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt, and more. It is a complete backend solution that includes all the essential features typically required in a backend project.

We are building a video hosting platform similar to YouTube, with key features such as:

- User login and sign-up
- Video upload functionality
- Like/Dislike videos
- Comment and reply to videos
- Subscribe/Unsubscribe to channels, and more.

Still building...

The project follows standard best practices, including using JWT, and Bcrypt for secure authentication, access tokens, refresh tokens, and more.
